# OOP SIMPLE NOTES

This is just a note about OOP which can use in every programming languages.

## Abstraction

How to define a problem into a class or OOP and all it's component.

## Encapsulation

How to manage the data or variable flow or restriction, which data to restrict or publish. In some programming languages encapsulation can be like this:
+ C++/C#/Java: Private, Protected, Public
+ Python: Data Hiding (Usually use __ )

## Inheritance

How to create a new class which still connect or need the function/variable from the main class.

## Polymorphism

Create same function which same with the function in main class, polymorphism were separated in to two section such as:

### Overload

Create same function which same with the function in main class, which that function has different parameter with the function in main class. That function can declare in main or inherited class. The main purposes were to create well documented function (same type) in the main or inherited class.

### Override

Create same function which the parameter were same with the function in main class. Usually this function declares in inherited class and the main purposes were to implement the function from the main class with the same parameters from main class. In some programming languages override can be like this:
+ C++: Use virtual
+ C#/Java: implement from abstract
+ Python: Just declare in inherited class
