## **Inheritance**

Create few class which still connect with the main class or need the function/variable from the main class. The example of Inheritance are in `inheritance1.py` and `inheritance2.py`. In `inheritance2.py` you will be see the implementation of the `__str__()` function, it will make debuging process inside a class more easier. And you can found the `super()` function followed by `__init__()`, that called to access the parent class constructor. But, to use the `__str__()` function from the parent class in the child class, you neet to call the `super()` function first. 

function followed by parent class constructor. So, you can access all 

## **The Problem of Inheritance** 

The problem of the inheritance are the return of the object when called like in `problem_class_access.py`, that solved by `solution_class_access.py`.

## **Composition**

This is one of the feature in Python that make all the process more easier, it can parse the object to other class. So, you can access or count the object like the example in `composition.py`.
