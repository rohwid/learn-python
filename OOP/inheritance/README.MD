## Inheritance

Create bew class which still connect with the main class or need the function/variable from the main class. The example of Inheritance are in `inheritance1.py` and `inheritance2.py`

## The Problem of Inheritance 

The problem in heritance are the return of the object when called like in `weird_class_access.py`, that solved by `solution_class_access.py`.

## Coposition

This is one of the feature in Python that make all the process more easier, it can parse the object to other class. So, you can access or count the object like the example in `composition.py`.
